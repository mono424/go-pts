# Echo example

This Echo example is a simple demonstration of how to use a go-pts websocket channel library.
It involves creating a websocket connection and sending a message to the server, which then echoes the message back to the client.
This example is useful for learning the basics of using websockets with go-pts in Go and can be easily extended to build more complex real-time applications.
